# DC-Motor-Direction-Control-with-L239D-Motor-Driver-and-Arduino

Overview:
This Arduino project demonstrates bidirectional control of a DC motor using an Arduino Uno and an L239D motor driver. Motor direction is controlled via serial input from a computer or terminal using the keyboard keys 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'.

Hardware Requirements:
1.Arduino Uno
2.L239D motor driver
3.DC motor
4.Connecting wires
5.External power supply for the motor (if required)

Software Requirements:
1.Arduino IDE

Installation and Setup
1.Hardware Setup:
Connect the DC motor to the outputs of the L239D motor driver (typically pins 3 and 6 for one motor).
Connect the control pins of the L239D motor driver to Arduino digital pins (e.g., pin 9 and pin 10).
Ensure all grounds are connected between the Arduino, motor driver, and power supply.
Arduino Setup:

2.Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into a new sketch.
Verify and upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno board.
Serial Communication Setup:

3.Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE or a compatible serial terminal on your computer.
Set the baud rate to 9600 (or adjust as per your sketch).
Usage
Use the following keys on your keyboard to control the motor:
W: Move the motor forward.
S: Move the motor backward.
A: Implement left turn logic (if applicable).
D: Implement right turn logic (if applicable).

Troubleshooting:
1.Motor Not Responding: Check connections between the Arduino, motor driver, and motor. Ensure power supply to the motor driver is adequate.
2.Incorrect Movement: Verify wiring and control logic in the Arduino code.
3.Serial Communication Issues: Ensure correct baud rate and serial port selection in your serial terminal.
